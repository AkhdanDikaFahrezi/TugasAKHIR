# App Flow Document for CodeGuide Starter Kit (TugasAKHIR)

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
A new user arrives at the application by navigating to the root URL, where the landing page is presented. This page highlights the project’s features with a hero section and offers clear calls to action to either sign in or create a new account. When the user chooses to sign up, they are guided through Clerk’s hosted sign-up interface. They can register with an email address and password or opt for social logins if configured, such as Google or GitHub. During sign-up, the user provides basic information and confirms their email address via a verification link sent automatically. Once verified, the user is redirected back to the application.

If the user already has an account, selecting the sign-in option takes them to Clerk’s hosted sign-in page. Here they enter their email and password or choose a social login option. In the event of a forgotten password, there is a “Forgot your password?” link. Clicking this link opens a password recovery prompt where the user enters their email and receives a reset link. After setting a new password, they are returned to the sign-in page. Once authenticated, the user is automatically redirected to the main dashboard. Signing out is handled by a sign-out button available in the header or user menu, which clears the session and returns the user to the landing page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After successful authentication, the user lands on the dashboard at `/dashboard`. The page features a top header that contains the application logo, a theme toggle for light and dark mode, and a user avatar menu. The avatar menu provides quick access to account settings, profile management, and the sign-out action. Below the header is the main content area, which by default displays an overview of the AI chat feature. A floating chat widget or dedicated chat panel invites the user to start a new conversation with the AI assistant.

On the left side of the dashboard, a collapsible navigation bar lists links for Chat, Profile, and any other protected sections that may be added later. The dashboard layout is built with shadcn/ui components, ensuring consistency in design and responsive behavior. From this central hub, users can navigate to each core feature page or open modal dialogs for quick tasks, such as changing theme settings or toggling preferences.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
The AI Chat feature is accessed by clicking the Chat link in the navigation bar or by interacting with the chat widget on the dashboard. This transition loads the chat page at `/dashboard/chat`, which contains the `Chat` component. When the user types a message and presses send, the UI leverages the `useChat` hook to post the message to `/api/chat`. On the server side, the API route processes the request using the Vercel AI SDK, streaming responses from the configured language model back to the client. As the response streams in, the chat interface updates in real time, displaying each token as it arrives.

Editing user profile information begins when the user selects the Profile link in the sidebar or the avatar menu. This navigates to `/profile`, where a form populated with information from Clerk is shown. The user can update their display name, email address, and other metadata exposed by Clerk. Upon submission, the form calls Clerk’s client functions to persist changes. Success and error messages appear inline, and a successful update returns the user to the dashboard with a brief confirmation banner.

Although no dedicated data table page is provided by default, any data management flows built on Supabase would follow a similar pattern. The user would navigate to a protected route, see a table or list powered by Supabase client utilities, and perform create, read, update, or delete actions. Each operation interacts with Supabase’s RLS-enabled database, and UI feedback is displayed on completion.

## Settings and Account Management
The account settings area is accessible through the user avatar menu in the header. When clicked, it opens a modal or page hosting the Clerk Account Management UI. Here, users can review active sessions, manage connected devices, change their password, and configure two-factor authentication if enabled. Notification preferences and email settings are also available through this interface. Billing or subscription settings would appear under a separate tab in this account area, but by default billing is not part of this starter kit. After making any changes, users can close the settings overlay and return directly to the dashboard or the last visited page.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If the user enters invalid credentials at sign-in or sign-up, Clerk displays an inline error message prompting correction. When a password reset link is expired or invalid, the password recovery flow shows an appropriate warning and allows the user to request a new link. In the chat interface, network interruptions or server-side issues cause a message in the chat window explaining the error and offering a retry button. If an unauthenticated user attempts to access a protected route such as `/dashboard` or `/profile`, the Clerk middleware intercepts the request and redirects them back to the sign-in page.

On the server side, if environment variables for OpenAI or Supabase are misconfigured, the API endpoints return a 500 error with a descriptive message. The client displays a generic error banner inviting the user to try again later. A missing page or incorrect URL results in Next.js’s default 404 page, which includes a link back to the landing page for safe navigation.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From the first visit to the application’s landing page, the user experiences a smooth onboarding with Clerk’s authentication screens. Once authenticated, they arrive at a clear and modern dashboard built with shadcn/ui and TailwindCSS, where dark mode can be toggled instantly. The AI chat feature provides real-time conversational assistance powered by the Vercel AI SDK and OpenAI/Anthropic models. Profile updates and account management are handled through the Clerk account UI, while Supabase integration runs transparently behind the scenes. Error states are managed gracefully with user-friendly messages and automatic redirections, ensuring a continuous and coherent flow. Throughout every step, the user can move seamlessly from signing up to engaging with advanced features, guaranteeing a complete end-to-end experience in this starter kit environment.
